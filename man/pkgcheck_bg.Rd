\usage{
pkgcheck_bg(path)

\item{path}{Path to local repository}
}
\value{
A \pkg{processx} object connecting to the background process
generating the main \link{pkgcheck} results (see Note).
}
\description{
Generate report on package compliance with rOpenSci Statistical Software
requirements as background process
}
\note{
The return object will by default display whether it is still running,
or whether it has finished. Once it has finished, the results can be obtained
by calling \verb{$get_result()}, or the main \link{pkgcheck} function can be
called to quickly retrieve the main results from local cache.

This function does not accept the \code{extra_env} parameter of the main
\link{pkgcheck} function, and can not be used to run extra, locally-defined
checks.
