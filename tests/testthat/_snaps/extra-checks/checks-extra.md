Statistical properties of package structure as distributional percentiles in relation to all current CRAN packages
The following terminology is used:

- `loc` = "Lines of Code"
- `fn` = "function"
- `exp`/`not_exp` = exported / not exported

All parameters are explained as tooltips in the locally-rendered HTML version of this report generated by [the `checks_to_markdown()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/reference/checks_to_markdown.html)


The final measure (`fn_call_network_size`) is the total number of calls between functions (in R), or more abstract relationships between code objects in other languages. Values are flagged as "noteworthy" when they lie in the upper or lower 5th percentile.
